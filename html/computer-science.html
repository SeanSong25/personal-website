                    <p class="course-content">
                        This course provided an introduction of fundamental programming principles to me using C language.
                        Topics included procedures and parameter passing, array and structures, recursion, sorting, pointers
                        and dynamic data structures and space and time analysis. I particularly enjoyed the introduction to pointers,
                        as it opened a whole new world of data structures to me.

                        This course was built on the foundation of CS137 and was taught using C++.
                        It introduced fundamental data structures to me such as trees, linked-lists, hashtables etc.
                        Beside data structures, it also introduced Object-Oriented programming to me. Overall, it reviewed and
                        dug deeper into Object Oriented Programming and important data structures that I would often use
                        while coding my own projects or just leetcoding.

                        <p>This is the first full-stack application that I built using express.js and Vue.js.
                            The style is formatted using the Element UI Library with some additional twicking using css and the 
                            backend database is MySQL. The application allows you to add and drop tables on a search tree. It also
                            makes weekly planning easy for that you could add detailed procedures for an activity using secondary tables,
                            and edit your table at any time. Click on the project image to get to the deployed project on Ali Cloud.

                        <p>
                            The Speeding Block is a Unity Game I built alongside my partner Emma He. It is a fun little game built following this tutorial:
                            <a class="tut-vid" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nfaPDPA-Y8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nfaPDPA-Y8</a>
                            We built it for our first hackathon event, and it won second place as well!(Although there's only 5 teams) We only had 3 days to learn the tutorial and build the game,
                            and we had absolutely zero knowledge about Unity and C# before the Hackathon. Now, you may think that it is just a really easy copy from someone else, but I would still consider it a great accomplishment. 
                            It was a meaningful project, because it was the first ever project
                            I built under a pressure for delivery. Moreover, beside the functions in the tutorial, we were also able to add our own features in it, such as the gold bars and 
                            health points. In order to apply these simple modifications, we had to research and actually understand the code we were writing.
                            This process of learning was the most valuable lesson I gained through this project.

                        <p>
                            The Block-breaker game is basically a copy of Google's BrickBreaker. I wrote in Grade 12 as a practice project
                            for the Java skills I learnt from school. The game is built using Java Applet, and with a background theme of 
                            MineCraft. Although this is not the prettiest project I built, it is one of the first ever project I built, and enjoyed.
                            The code repository is on my github account, so check it out!
